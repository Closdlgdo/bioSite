            Hello everyone, her name is Theano Delgado (Palaiochoriti). She is my wife and soon to be mother of our first child. She is currently working on some side courses in Microsoft Excel and is also working full time as a Student Enrollment Advisor for Zovio. They are in direct connections with University of Arizona Global Campus. She has been working with them for a few months. She is a lover of the outdoors and nature as well as the occasional kickback. She has been to more than half of the United States and has hiked many trails. Some of her goals and aspirations that she has are that she wants to visit Zion National Park to hike/camp. She is very keen on wanting to win the lottery but if that fails, she also wants to work in Real Estate. She is originally from Greece and is extremely fluent in the Greek language. Not many people know this, but she is a college graduate from Greece in the field of Fashion Design. The wildest thing she has ever done was to move to the United States all by herself and make it work out. All of her immediate family lives in Greece. She also has a twin brother. Some of her future goals that she has planned out are obviously to be a great mother who I know she will be. And second, to go back to school for Criminal Justice.
