                <h2>Being a new mother!</h2>
                <p>I have dreamnt of being a mother ever since I could remember. The thought of finally getting to be a mother is just mind blowing. I have been fortunate enough to work as a nanny for roughly 5 years so I believe taking care of the baby will come with ease. We have known the sex of the baby and without a shadow of a doubt I knew that we would have a boy. This is one of my greatest and favoritest moments of my life.</p>

                <h2>Studying and growing!</h2>
                <p> I got my Associates degree with a major of Fashion Design from Greece. I believed that is what I wanted to do when I was younger but as I've gotten older, my likings have definitely changed. I have taken courses in excel, nutrition, different languages like spanish and portuguese. I am full Greek so I speak that fluently and english as well. One of my biggest passions is Criminal Justice. I believe that learning every single day is one of the greatest things in life we can do.</p>

                <h2>Traveling all over!</h2>
                <p>There are not many things that can beat a good roadtrip or flight in my opinion. I enjoy learnig and visiting different states and the different people. I have been fortunate enough to travel all over the United States. I have traveled to over 30 states and some if not all of their landmarks. Something about the sceneries that makes it all worth it. It also gives me a good amount of time to decompress and make me forget about work. </p>
