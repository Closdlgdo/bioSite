            <h2>Hiking</h2>
            <p>My love for hiking began when I moved to Colorado. Before that I was not really that interested in the outdoors unless it dealt with the beach. Something about the clean air and the beautiful mountain tops and terrains just makes me happy.</p>

            <h2>Camping</h2>
            <p> Although I have not done it often, camping is one of my joys in life. Being in the outdoors with family and/or friends is a blast. Sleeping under the moonlight cozied up in my sleeping bag is a a sight to see. The stars always shine brighter.</p>

            <h2>Long drives/trips</h2>
            <p>There are not many things that can beat a good roadtrip in my opinion. Typically there are great trips and drives whenever I am going anywhere to camp or to hike. It can be 30 minutes or it can be days and days of driving. The wind blowing in my hair, the scenery, the snacks pilled up on my lap and the sweet sounds blasting through the speakers are what make going on drives amazing. It also gives me a good amount of time to decompress and make me forget about work. </p>
